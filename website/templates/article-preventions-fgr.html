        <p>
          Although FGR can occur even when a mother is perfectly healthy, there
          are things mothers can do to reduce the risk of FGR and increase the
          odds of a healthy pregnancy and baby.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep all of your prenatal appointments. Detecting potential problems
            early allows you to treat them early.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be aware of your baby's movements. A baby who doesn't move often or
            who stops moving may have a problem. If you notice changes in your
            baby's movement, call your doctor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check your medications. Sometimes a medication a mother is taking
            for another health problem can lead to problems with her unborn
            baby.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eat healthfully. Healthy foods and ample calories help keep your
            baby well nourished.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get plenty of rest. Rest will help you feel better and it may even
            help your baby grow. Try to get 8 hours of sleep (or more) each
            night. An hour or two of rest in the afternoon is also good for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice healthy lifestyle habits. If you drink alcohol, take drugs,
            or smoke, stop for the health of your baby.
